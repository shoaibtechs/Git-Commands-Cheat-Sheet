git remote add origin "url" //Adding a folder with repository.....

git remote -v //Tells us that how many repositories are attached with it.

git push origin master //Pushing the work on Github....

git branch shoaib //Crearting a new branch instead of commiting on main

git checkout shoaib //Checking out that bracnch....NOw we can commit on it...

//---------------PUll---------------------------------------

git clone "forked url"

git remote add upstream "original url from we have forked"

git branch shoaib //Creating a new branch coz we dont have to commit on main branch

git checkout shoaib //Switching to the shoaib branch...

//Now if we have to push commits then we have to give the name of the branch below....

git push origin "new branch name"

//--------Removing a commit---------------

-> The commit we have to remove so, we have to copy its the hashcode below it and then give the below command 

git reset "hashcode"
git stash 
git push origin "branch name" -f //forcefully pushing it.....

//------Pull request-------------------------------------

//Now we have done changes in the "upstream main branch" but if as we earlier mentioned that 
we have done this using creating different branches....so in our main branch there are not the 
same commits that we have so we are going to do this that "our forked main" and the 
"upstream forked main" should have same commits  

git checkout main

git fetch --all --prune 

git reset --hard upstream/main 

git push origin main
